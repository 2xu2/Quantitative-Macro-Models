# Restuccia and Rogerson
Replicates Restuccia and Rogerson 2008 which uses an industry dynamics along the lines of Hopenhayn (1992) embedded with the neoclassical growth model. Firms are heterogenous in productivity. Productivity is constant over time and while entry is endogenous, there is only exogenous exit. (Note that my code Hopenhayn 1992 -- Version 2 is similar but has fluctuating productivity and endogenous exit).

*Detailed Description*. The authors show that resource misallocation across heterogenous firms can have sizeable negative effects on aggregate output and TFP even when policy does not relay on aggregate capital accumulation or aggregate relative price differences. The paper highlights the importance of resource misallocation across firms with different levels of productivity and could potentially explain cross-country differences in output per capita. The code calculates the efficient or benchmark economy and then compares  economies under a policy distortion of either output, capital or labor which reallocates resources among firms through tax/subsidies. Each firm faces its own tax or subdidy. To emphasize the effects, for each tax rate the code finds the subsidy rate that will generate the same aggregate capital stock as the benchmark economy. The focus is on policies that create idiosyncratic distortions to establishment-level decisions and hence cause a reallocation of resources across establishments.
