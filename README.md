# Quantitative-Macro-Models
This is a collection of code for quantitative macroeconomic models that I have written or modified from someone else. Every file includes references. I coded these models as a personal learning exercise and the algorithms are not optimized. 

Unless otherwise specified the models in the same folder but written in different coding languages will do the same thing. 

You are welcome to download and use anything here!
